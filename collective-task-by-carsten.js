// Fork this repository and once you are done, create a pull request of your work!

// ## INSTRUCTIONS

// Create a file based on your github username, for example "Req.js". Only edit that file, don't add any other files.
// Make sure that any code you add is formatted consistently and  very well (indentation levels are logical, for example).

// In that file, create 2 student tasks and solutions to each of the following concepts.

//     - How if-else statements work

// If Else #1
// Checks if a 2 remainder of a float number is larger than the 2 remainder of the same number but rounded (up or down).
// Display the boolean result in a sentence, i.e. "Remainder of <float> is larger than remainder of <rounded>."
// Start with -> let float = 3.14.

//     - How switch statements work

// Create a price finder function for the super market: Oranges cost EUR1.17 per kilo, Apples are EUR0.99 per kg, Bananas are expensive with EUR2.19 per kg and lemons are cheap with EUR0.67 / kg.
// Display the prices in short sentences, i.e. "Oranges: €<price> per kg".
// If input is any other fruit, display "<fruit> not available".
// Use switch statements.

//     - How loops work

//     - How functions work

// Function #1
// Create a function with 4 parameters and give them arguments, i.e. parameter #0 added with paramenter #1 is larger or less than paramter #3 multiplied  with parameter #4.
// Explain in short comments how the function works.
